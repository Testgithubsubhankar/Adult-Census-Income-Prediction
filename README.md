This income prediction project involves many Machine learning algorithm and techniques. 
```
Abstract:
```
```
The prominent inequality of wealth and income is
a huge concern especially in the developed countries.The likelihood
of diminishing poverty is one valid reason to reduce the world's
surging level of economic inequality. The principle of universal
moral equality ensures sustainable development and improve
the economic stability of a nation. Governments in different
countries have been trying their best to address this problem and
provide an optimal solution. This study aims to show the usage
of machine learning techniques in providing a
solution to the income equality problem.
